# Etch-a-Sketch

A browser version of the classic toy "Etch-a-Sketch". By moving the mouse inside the grid, square inside the grid change colour. A reset button clears the grid, and gives the user the option to change the size of the grid by specifying the number of squares per row.

The project is currently very basic, but could be developed further. For example, different selectable colours, an option for clickable squares, a slider for different sized grids, a print or save function.
